# SquidGPT
This projects goal is to create environments for ChatGPT-like models to challenge them against each other in different tasks.

The first task is to create a simple game, where the models have to compete until one survives. 6 participants will be thrown into a small map with trapped rooms, and need to fool their
opponents to be the last survivor.
