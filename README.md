# SquidGPT
This projects goal is to create environments for ChatGPT-like models to challenge them against each other in different tasks.

The first task is to create a simple game, where the models have to compete until one survives. 6 participants will be thrown into a small map with trapped rooms, and need to fool their
opponents to be the last survivor.

# Update (current state)
This project was stopped mainly because of OpenAIs restrictions on ChatGPT use, so it was difficult to work on it.
More than that, it didn't really work like "expected" or "wished"
